# 447-Project-Jack-Fan

Proposal

Team: Jack Fan

Project theme: 

The topic I have chosen involves a scientific comparison between a Bayesian estimator and another Bayesian or non-Bayesian estimator. It explores whether the Bayesian method for these common inference problems can be improved by utilizing the data types for the covariates/features, groups of related features (e.g. feature templates) and hierarchical approaches. The Bayesian method of time series and state-space model will be deeply discussed, and the application of Bayesian method in spatial data analysis will be studied, such as how to effectively deal with spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity.


Short Summary of Potential Approaches:

1.Select an appropriate data from real-world data sets.
2.Implement the chosen estimator using Python. Run the estimator on the selected dataset and gather results according to comparison criteria.
3.Analyze and compare the results of different estimators. Use plots and statistical tests for the analysis, considering the performance of estimators under various conditions, such as different data sizes and feature distributions.
4.Conclude based on the analysis. Discuss the strengths and limitations of the estimators, as well as their potential impact in practical applications. Suggest recommendations for future work, including possible improvements, new comparison criteria, or exploration of different data types.
